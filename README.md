# Covid-Detection-Classification
- It involves training a deep learning model to classify chest X-ray or CT scan images as either positive or negative for the virus. The CNN extracts features from the images through multiple convolutional layers and uses them for classification. This approach can achieve high accuracy, helping in the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19.
