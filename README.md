# Covid-Detection-Classification
- It involves training a deep learning model to classify chest X-ray or CT scan images as either positive or negative for the virus. The CNN extracts features from the images through multiple convolutional layers and uses them for classification. This approach can achieve high accuracy, helping in the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19.
- A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to classify COVID-19 cases based on chest X-ray or CT scan images.
- CNNs automatically detect patterns and features from medical images for classification.
- Input data is preprocessed, including resizing and normalization, to ensure consistent image dimensions.
- The CNN architecture consists of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- Convolutional layers extract features like edges, textures, and shapes from input images.
- Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the image to focus on important features and reduce computational cost.
- Fully connected layers integrate the extracted features for classification.
- The network is trained using a labeled dataset, where the images are categorized as COVID-19 positive or negative.
- A loss function such as categorical cross-entropy is used to compute errors during training.
- Optimization algorithms like Adam or SGD adjust the weights to minimize classification errors.
- Dropout or regularization techniques are applied to avoid overfitting.
- The model is validated on a separate test dataset to evaluate its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- CNN-based models can achieve high accuracy in detecting COVID-19 when trained on large and diverse datasets.
